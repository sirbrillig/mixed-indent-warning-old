# Mixed Indent Warning

**NOTE: This plugin is deprecated! Please use the updated [linter-mixed-indent](https://github.com/sirbrillig/linter-mixed-indent) instead!**

An [Atom](https://atom.io/) plugin to mark lines that have differing indentation (spaces vs. tabs).

When a file contains both types of indentation, lines using the less-commonly used indentation will be marked in the editor.
